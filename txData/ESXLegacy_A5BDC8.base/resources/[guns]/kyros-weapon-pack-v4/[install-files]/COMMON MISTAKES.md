HI DUMB ASS... OR SOMEONE WONDERING WHY I TYPED THIS!.. ITS BECAUSE SOME OF YALL CANT READ.. ITS LIKE THE #1 ISSUE IN THE WORLD. BUT YET PEOPLE WILL SAY THEY CAN!


[1] : 

Issue | "Where are the images..? You said look in the discord but i cant find them"

Solution | Well dumbass the solution is that they are posted in your original purchase ticket.. SCROLL UP. Now if you no longer have that ticket opened. ASK AGAIN IN A NEW TICKET FOR IMAGES AND WHICH SET. Now if you are a dev... to damn bad ask the owner of the pack.


[2] :

Issue | "My guns aren't pulling out"

Solution | Down below! 

1. Check if the resource is starting... 
2. If your using ox_inventory are your weapons have no green line at the bottom that means you cant read in order to fix you must.. Remove weapons out of data base and in items.lua in the ox_inventory files NEXT TIME READ.


[3] :

Issue | "I can't use attachment on *gun name* but I can on this other *gun name*" 

Solution | Not every gun has an attachment some can have 5 different attachments, and another one could have 0. 


[4] :

Issue | "I'm using ox_inventory and the attachments don't have images? where can i find them?"

Solution | The creators of ox_inventory never made attachment images.. its on the creator of the inventory to supply images for attachments not me.


[5] :

Issue | "What are the spawn codes for the attachments?"

Solution | Nigga.. You should know your own inventories spawn codes.
